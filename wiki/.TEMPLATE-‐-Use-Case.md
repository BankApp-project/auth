# Use Case: [Use Case Name]

**(Example: `Initiate Verification`, `Complete Passkey Authentication`, `Create User Profile`)**

## Goal

_A brief, 1-2 sentence description of the use case's purpose from a business or user perspective. What is its primary
responsibility? Why does it exist?_

---

## Process Flow

_Describe the sequence of operations orchestrated by the use case's `handle` method. This should be a high-level
narrative focusing on the "what," not the "how." Use a numbered or bulleted list. Each step should represent a
significant business operation or interaction with a dependency._

1. **[First Step]**: _(e.g., Load a domain entity from a repository)._
2. **[Second Step]**: _(e.g., Delegate core logic to a Domain Service)._
3. **[Third Step]**: _(e.g., Call an outgoing port to interact with an external system)._
4. **[Fourth Step]**: _(e.g., Persist the final state back to a repository)._
5. **[Final Step]**: _(e.g., Return a result or grant to the caller)._
